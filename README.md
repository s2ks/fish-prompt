My configuration for [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell).

# Requirements

- A patched font (like [NerdFont](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)).

# Installing

`$ cd ~/.config && git clone https://github.com/s2ks/fish-prompt.git fish`

# Notes

neovim is aliased to `vim`, and real (or retro) vim in turn is aliased to `rvim`.
